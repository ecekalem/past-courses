## Warning

The code for the final project, `finalProject/proje.py`, throws an error saying "'Series' object has no attribute 'get_values'". Apparently, this specific method I used when coding the project (around 2020 January) to retrieve values from a column of a pandas DataFrame is deprecated. I am leaving the code as is.
